# Server-Client-Model-using-Hash-Code-Cryptography
Secure message transmission using Diffie-Hellman key exchange, AES encryption, and SHA-512 hashing to ensure confidentiality and integrity.

This project demonstrates secure message exchange between a client and server, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
It includes:

SHA-512 hashing to generate a secure hash code of a given message.

Diffie-Hellman key exchange to securely generate a shared session key.

AES encryption to encrypt both the message and its hash for confidentiality.

Integrity verification by validating the received hash against the message.

Features
Generate SHA-512 hash codes.

Secure session key generation using Diffie-Hellman.

Encrypt and decrypt messages using AES symmetric encryption.

Ensure data integrity by verifying message hashes after decryption.

Technologies Used
Python 3

Cryptography library (for AES, Diffie-Hellman)

hashlib (for SHA-512)
