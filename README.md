# Server-Client Model using Hash Code Cryptography

**Secure message transmission** using **Diffie-Hellman key exchange**, **AES encryption**, and **SHA-512 hashing** to ensure confidentiality and integrity.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates secure message exchange between a client and server, ensuring **confidentiality** and **integrity**.

It includes:
- **SHA-512 hashing** to generate a secure hash code of a given message.
- **Diffie-Hellman key exchange** to securely generate a shared session key.
- **AES encryption** to encrypt both the message and its hash for confidentiality.
- **Integrity verification** by validating the received hash against the message.

## Features

- Generate SHA-512 hash codes.
- Secure session key generation using Diffie-Hellman.
- Encrypt and decrypt messages using AES symmetric encryption.
- Ensure data integrity by verifying message hashes after decryption.
